                    <p>If you love the happy hues you're seeing all over TikTok and Instagram, you're not alone. Pastel tones are having a major moment, pioneered by a new breed of trend-setters who are trading traditionally minimalist Scandi design for statement curves and kitsch accessories splashed with mood-boosting colours. <br/>Whether you incorporate the playful aesthetic via home decor pieces, dinnerware or a bright new set of bed linen, these three elements are key to turning your home into a Danish pastel paradise.<br/></p><br/>

                    <p>Embrace pastel colours
                    First and foremost, the Danish pastel interior trend is all about beautiful soft hues. Blush pink, cornflower blue, butter yellow; liberally apply these tones to everything from the plates and bowls in your kitchen to the armchair in your living room. The Danish pastel aesthetic is so much more than a single pop of colour, so don't be afraid to extend ice-cream tones across multiple home decor pieces—nothing is off limits! To break up blocks of colour, incorporate Danish pastel-approved patterns such as gingham, checks or stylised florals.</p><br/>

                    <p>Highlight curves
                    In a nod to the organic lines of Scandi furniture design, the Danish pastel trend embraces curved sofas, dining chairs and coffee tables—but it doesn't stop there. The Danish pastel look pushes interiors into a playful new space by championing squiggly lines, too. Mirrors are a great way to incorporate the statement silhouette, and we're taking inspiration from the curvy contours of Ettore Sottsass' iconic Ultrafragola mirror, which has undulated its way into Danish pastel homes around the world.</p><br/>

                    <p>Incorporate kitsch accents
                    A love of objects, books, candles and ceramics has always been central to Scandi interior design. This notion remains core to the Danish pastel look, though the spirited trend favours objects that lean a little more kitsch. Think two-tone twisted candles, a clamshell-shaped jewellery tray or liquorice allsorts wall art. And hey, if you love a disco ball moment, Danish pastel is one decor trend that lets you live out your dancefloor dreams all year round.</p><br/>
